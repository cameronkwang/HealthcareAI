# Insurance Carrier Renewal Methodology Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive implementation of insurance carrier renewal methodologies for UHC, AETNA, CIGNA, and BCBS. All implementations follow the established universal period handling logic and provide complete calculator, template, and testing coverage.

## Universal Infrastructure

### Period Handling Logic (`src/utils/periodHandling.ts`)
- **24+ months**: Split into 12-month current + 12-month prior periods
- **13-23 months**: 12-month current + remainder as prior 
- **4-11 months**: Single current period with annualization
- **<4 months**: Error for insufficient data
- **Large claimant validation**: Automatic validation and annualization for partial year data

### Common Types (`src/types/common.ts`)
- Unified data structures for claims, member data, and experience periods
- Consistent large claimant handling across all carriers
- Standardized result interfaces with warnings and data quality metrics

## Technical Architecture

### Calculator Pattern
All carriers follow a consistent calculator pattern:
```typescript
class CarrierCalculator {
  constructor(input: CarrierInput) { }
  calculate(): CarrierResult { }
  private calculateSpecificComponents() { }
}
```

### Template Pattern  
All carriers use consistent React template structure:
- Summary cards with key metrics
- Detailed calculation tables
- Experience period analysis
- Data quality assessment
- Warning systems

### Testing Pattern
All carriers have comprehensive test coverage:
- Full calculation flow testing
- Individual component verification
- Period handling scenarios
- Error condition testing
- Data quality validation

## Key Differentiators by Carrier

| Carrier | Pooling Threshold | Period Usage | Unique Features |
|---------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| UHC     | $125,000         | 70%/30% Split | 25-line methodology, credibility sqrt formula |
| CIGNA   | $50,000          | Single 12-month | Dual columns, claims fluctuation corridor |
| BCBS    | Plan-specific    | 12-month | Multi-plan composite, enrollment weighting |
| AETNA   | $100,000         | Experience periods | 28-line, 7-column structure |
